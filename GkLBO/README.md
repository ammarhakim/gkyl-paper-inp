Gyrokinetic LBO (GkLBO) collision operator

Input files used for the paper describing the implementation and tests of the GkLBO. These input files do the following:

- gsi2-ionSound-p1: Collisional Landau damping of an acoustic sound wave.
- helimak: 5D simulation of the Texas Helimak toroidal device.
- helimak-lowColl: 5D simulation of the Texas Helimak toroidal device, with
  collisionality 10x smaller.
- lboRelax-1x2v-p1: collisional relaxation of rectangular and bump-in-tail
  distributions, with piecewise linear basis.
- lboRelax-1x2v-p2: collisional relaxation of rectangular and bump-in-tail
  distributions, with piecewise quadratic basis.
