Notes:
figure 1: Run at various collision frequencies to build up the data for the plot.
figure 3: Run at multiple spatial resolutions to build up the data for the oscillation around the shock.
figures 3, 8, 9 all used the annulus sodshock with various resoltuions and inital conditions as indicated by the figure captions and text. For Figure 9, panel (c), "triads" model id was used to produce the normalized momentum and the polt was divided by the Jacobian J in order to be produced.
