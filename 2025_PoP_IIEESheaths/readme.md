2025 General kinetic ion-induced electron emission model for metallic walls applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes (PoP paper)

All results in this paper use revision [4dda10bbc b181c5b50](https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkyl/commit/76220f59c607c7748e1f8e8c5b4f8a5cb4b3f536 (HEAD -> gk-g0-app)) of gkylzero.

Only the 9 kV simulations are given here. For the other cases in the paper, please change the bias potential accordingly.

1. The NoEmission cases are for classical sheaths without emissions. The bias potential can be changed on line 154.
2. The IIEE cases are for emissive sheaths with copper electrodes. The bias potential can be changed on line 162. If you want to use a different electrode material, please change lines 172-179 to the appropriate values from Table 1 in the paper.
