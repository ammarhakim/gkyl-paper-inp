2026 Effects of parallel magnetic fields on sheaths near biased electrodes in a highly collisional Z-pinch plasma (Physics of Plasmas, Submitted)

All results in this paper use revision [52274682f296cf2ab772b0a75f126aa5d98c2924](https://github.com/ammarhakim/gkeyll/commit/52274682f296cf2ab772b0a75f126aa5d98c2924).

Input files for the 0, 5, and 10 kV cases for an axial cut of a Z-pinch plasma between two biased electrodes and in the presence of a static background magnetic field. 

These input files are general and can be used for arbitrary radii in a Z-pinch plasma. The radius can be changed on line 217. You can also arbitrarily change the bias potential on line 269. Note, that when changing both of these (especially radius), you need to consider the total domain size to make sure you are adequately resolving the ion gyroradius.
