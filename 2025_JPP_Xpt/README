List of Input Files Used in the Paper:

gridstep2x.c:
   - An input file that just generates a STEP grid for plotting (no full simulation setup)
   - Used for fig 1a, 2b, and 3.

gridmbasdex_2x.c:
   - An input file that just generates an asdex grid for plotting (no full simulation setup)
   - Used for fig 1b and 4

griddn.c:
   - Used in section 7.1 to test convergence of the volume.
   - Using line 74 includes the X-point, replacing it with line 75 excludes the X-point.

awaybump_grad_mod_succesfulconvergence_physbcs_poissonsn.c:
   - Section 7.2 poisson test away from X-point

uniform_grad_mod_succesful_convergence_onebumpxpt_physicalbcs_poissonsn.c
   - Section 7.2 poisson test on X-point

rt_gk_step9.c:
   - STEP simulation plotted in the paper in section 7
   - Update: This input file is with no drifts and is used for the arxiv version of the paper. 
     In the revised version we include drifts and use step28.c


unit_nearxpt_gaussian_zhat_succesful_convergence_advectbump.c
   - Section 7.3 advection of gaussian blob near X-point

step28.c:
   - Section 7.4 double nul multiblock step simulation input file used for particle conservation test.
