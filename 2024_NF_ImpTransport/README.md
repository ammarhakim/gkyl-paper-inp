Zamperini, S. A., Bernard, T. A., Rudakov, D. L. & Boedo, J. A. Turbulent drifts of impurity ions as an explanation for anomalous radial transport in the far-SOL of DIII-D. Nucl. Fusion 64, 074002 (2024).

Simulation was run using g2 on Perlmutter. Follow up simulations of impurity transport were done using a python script that was the precursor to the Flan impurity transport code.
