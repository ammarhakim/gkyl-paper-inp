Input files to reproduce the Helimak simulations in the paper. Note that the data in the paper was produced from simulations run using the first version of Gkeyll. These input files has been adapted from the orginal files in order to run using the current version of Gkeyll. Therefore, results of the input files may deviate slightly from those in the paper.

helimak-gnd.lua : grounded scenario, V_bias = 0 V
helimak-biasP.lua : positive limiter-biasing scenario, V_bias = 10 V
helimak-biasN.lua : negative limiter-biasing scenario, V_bias = -40 V
