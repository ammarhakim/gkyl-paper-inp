2022 Paper on kinetic simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01815

These input files are for the three kinetic simulations in the paper:

- ```01-Kn-0_1-64.lua```: Kn = 0.1, least collisional
- ```02-Kn-0_01-64.lua```: Kn = 0.01, intermediate
- ```03-Kn-0_001-64.lua```: Kn = 0.001, most collisional
